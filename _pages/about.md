I am a first-year Ph.D. student advised by Prof. [Huixia Judy Wang](https://statistics.columbian.gwu.edu/huixia-wang) at the [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.columbian.gwu.edu/), [the George Washington University](https://www.gwu.edu/). Before that, I received my master degree in Statistics at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://sds.wustl.edu/). Prior to the graduate school, I did my B.S. in Mathematics at [Hongyi Honor College](https://hyxt.whu.edu.cn/index.htm), [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Xiufen Zou](https://jszy.whu.edu.cn/zouxiufen/zh_CN/index.htm).

My primary research include predictive uncertainty quantification, especially conformal prediction. I am interested in combining statistical methods with deep learning architectures analyzing biomedical data.
